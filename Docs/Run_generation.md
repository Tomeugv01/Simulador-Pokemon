# Team Generation

## Pokemon selector

- Using different ranges of the total_stats value, random teams will be seleected for the opponent, creating an enviroment where teams are created with a difficulty progression is as best reflected as possible
- A similar method will be implemented for the player team, a first team of pokemon will be given with a predetermined range of stats and after each encounter, he will be givven the option to add or swap a new mon of progresivly stronger characteristics

## Move selector

- Once a Pokemon is selected to be added to a team, the move selection proces will begin.
- Depending on the relative value of each stat of the mon (what percentage of their stats are alocated to each one) it will be assigned to a different archetype and thus it will get assigned 4 differnt random moves that fall onto this archetypes.
- In the probable case that a pokemon falls into more than one of these archetypes, its 4 moves will be randomly selected between all of the possible pools of moves
- After each encounter, instead of adding a new pokemon to his team, the player will also get the option to replace one of his moves with an other one of ANY archetype of his liking.
